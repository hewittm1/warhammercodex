                            Use this Stratagem when taking a Psychic test for a <b>X’Tal Psyker</b>. Roll three dice rather than two and pick the two highest rolls.  (“Psychic Channelling” Grey Knights p. 99)

                             Use this Stratagem in your Movement phase. Select a <b>Silexia</b> unit from your army that is within 1” of an enemy unit. That unit can Fall Back, shoot and charge in this turn. (“Invisible Hunter” Tyranids codex p. 119)

                             Use this Stratagem during your movement phase. Select a X’tal Glass unit. Until the start of your next Movement phase, enemy models can only shoot this unit if it is the closest visible target.

                             War acts as a remembrance of how these obsolete soldiers once trained furiously and without relent.

                            Use this Stratagem when a <b>Perlumite</b> unit is chosen to attack in the Fight phase. Each time you make a hit roll of 6+ for a model in this unit during this phase, it can immediately make an extra attack against the same target using the same weapon. These extra attacks cannot themselves generate any further attacks.
