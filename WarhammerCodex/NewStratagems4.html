                          The X'Tal acknowledge that unity is strength, but the Gems are capable of sacrificing this known advantage for a more divided tactic.

                           Use this Stratagem at the start of any of your Movement phases. Select a friendly <b>X’Tal Gem</b> unit that has 10 models. That unit is immediately split into two separate units, each containing 5 models. (“Tactical Flexibility” Grey knights)

                             Of the X’Tal, the Greater Ignia are among the most mindful; they can improve upon their skills through the act of acknowledging their flaws.
                        </p>

                             Use this Stratagem at the start of your Shooting phase. Select a friendly <b>Greater Ignia</b> unit within 6” of your warlord. You can add 2 to your Second Chance roll for that unit.

                             Even when facing the most deadliest of adversaries, the X’Tal are only known to accelerate into battle with neither fear nor regret.

                               Use this Stratagem at the start of your Movement phase. Select a friendly <b>X’Tal</b> unit. It will make the Momentum Ability go one up in degree (ex. If it’s the unit’s first charge move, instead of adding a D3, you would add a D6).

                              One should not so easily underestimate the speed of the Resonites, for epinephrine still flows through these corroded warriors.
