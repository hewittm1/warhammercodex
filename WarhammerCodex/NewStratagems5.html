                        <p>
                             Some X’Tals are so omniscient and powerful that they can absorb and redirect mental attacks at a greater intensity.
                        </p>

                            Use this Stratagem in the Psychic Phase when you roll a successful Deny the Witch roll. Deal D3 Mortal wounds to the Psyker unit that had tried to cast the psychic power.

                            For as long as the X’Tal have existed, they have been known to acquiesce in that which victory can only be achieved through patience and perseverance.
                        </p>
                        <b>
                              Use this Stratagem when a friendly <b>Gem</b> unit is chosen to fight. You can re-roll any failed wound rolls for the unit if the target of the attack has the <b>Monster</b> keyword.

                           Even the most spirited fighters would lose their will when observing how futile their weapons are against such stone-shielded soldiers.

                             Use this Stratagem during the Morale phase. Select a unit of <b>Jet Obsilisk</b> or <b>Adamantia Neo</b> from your army. Your opponent must add 1 to any Morale tests taken for enemy units within 6” of that unit in this phase.

                             The Warp can provide rewarding enchantments for those that serve under its influence.

                            Use this Stratagem before the battle. Your army can have one extra Relic for 1 CP, or two extra Relics for 3 CPs. All of the relics that you include must be different and be given to different <b>X’Tal CHARACTERS</b>. You can only use this stratagem once per battle.
