                            These departed veterans have honed their targeting skills centuries after their reincarnation.

                            Use this Stratagem at the start of the Shooting phase. Select a friendly <b>Glass</b> unit. Until the end of the phase, you can reroll all failed hit rolls for all friendly <b>Infantry</b> units within 3“ of the selected unit.

                        <p>
                             During intense battles, the minerals from the X’Tal’s naturally formed skin fasten, toughening the warrior’s armor.

                             Use this Stratagem before rolling for saves. Afterwards, you may reroll all failed save rolls for that unit until the end of the phase.

                        <p>
                             At close quarters, the X’Tal have been well-trained to exploit the weakness of their opponents and end battles expeditiously.
                        </p>

                             Use this Stratagem at the beginning of any Fight phase. Select a friendly <b>X’Tal</b> unit. Until the end of the Fight phase, on a 6+ wound roll, the selected unit will inflict an additional wound.

                        <p>
                           Dwelling deep inside the solid chest, the X’Tal’s Secondary Heart increases the warrior’s performance by which it induces oxygen flow and nutrients to vital organs.
                        </p>
                        <b>
Use this Stratagem before the Charge phase. Select a friendly <b>X’Tal</b> unit. Any friendly units within 6” of the selected unit may Ignore the roll for the Charge phase and automatically charge the maximum distance for which that unit allows.

                            If provoked, the X'Tal can be brought into a frenzy and tear through their opponents with ease.
