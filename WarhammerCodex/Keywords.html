            <p>
               Throughout this book, you will come across a keyword that is within angular brackets, specifically <bold><i>Materia</i></bold>. This is shorthand for a keyword of your own keyword, as described below.
            </p>
        </div>

                <h1>
                    <bold><i>Materia</i></bold>             
                </h1>
                     <p>
                    All X’Tal units are drawn from a source of Materia. Some datasheets specify what Materia the unit is drawn from. If an X’Tal datasheet does not specify which Materia it is drawn from, it will have the <bold><i>Materia</i></bold>  keyword. When you include such a unit in your army, you must nominate which Materia that unit is from. You then simply replace the <bold><i>Materia</i></bold>  keyword in every instance on that unit’s datasheet with the name of your chosen Materia.
          
                     </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you were to include a Vitreom in your army, and you decide he was from the Ore Materia, his <bold><i>Materia</i></bold> Faction keyword is changed to Ore.              
                </p>
