            One of the many supporting variants of the X’Tal. Floating or scuttling, underground or crawling along the floors of the nearest seas, these troops are best used for their great adaptability and scouting potential. As the eyes and ears of the Collective, Phites allow for other X’Tal to know their surroundings before they’ve yet to even arrive to the next planet.
                <br><br><br>
                Like cameras, the Phites observe the X’Tal’s skirmishes with other races in order to record the information for latter use. Like this, even if the X’Tal were to lose the encounter, the information gathered from the fight would be more valuable than any victory.
