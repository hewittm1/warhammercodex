               A serpentine X'Tal that's mainly used for creating tunnel networks, brooding caves (Also known as forming caves), and other areas for the Collective as well as for harvesting resources from a planet's landmass. Sections of its body are designed to rotate at high speeds like a drill, and coupled with its razor-sharp mandibles, this allows it to cut through even the most persistent planet crusts.
