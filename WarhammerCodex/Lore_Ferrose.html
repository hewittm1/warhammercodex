             A serpentine X'Tal that's mainly used for creating tunnel networks, brooding caves (Also called “forming caves”), and other areas for the Collective as well as for harvesting resources from a planet's landmass. Sections of its body are designed to rotate at high speeds like a drill, and coupled with its razor-sharp mandibles, this allows it to cut through even the most persistent planet crusts.

                Aside from remodelling a planet, the Ferrosere Adama’s superior digging ability may also be used to spring upon unsuspecting prey, namely those wandering about in deserts or rocky landscapes. It can easily track down the vibrations of footsteps from kilometers away.
                                <br><br><br>
It can burrow under large oppositions and wait underneath them to pull them down into a sinkhole, essentially placing them out of battle. After being dragged, the Ferrosere will finish and bury the enemy, leaving them to suffer an unusual fate, as other Ferroseres will come to swarm it. Not even Phantom Titans are safe from suffering this fate.
