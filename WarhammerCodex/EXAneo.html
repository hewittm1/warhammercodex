                      <h2>
                      THE UNBREAKABLE TITAN: THE ADAMANTIA NEO
                      </h2>
                    <br><p> 
A great and flawless juggernaut, the impenetrable hide of the Adamantia Neo yields to neither bullet nor blade. This massive X'tal acts as a perfect fortress for the many legions of crystals it commands, and its wide bulk allows for unstoppable breaches unto untaken lands. 

<br><br>
This titan’s body is a perfect recipe of gene-seeds being surrounded by the extremely high pressure of its host planet's mantle, coupled with absorbing already-formed diamonds with a heavy splash of the Warp's influence. It takes several hundred Terran years for a perfect Adamantia Neo to even begin to reach the standard of perfection needed to lead a X'Tal fleet, but the result is an unrivalled defense that not even the strongest of artillery can pierce with ease of any sort. This immovable giant looms silently over the battlefield, using its powerful energies to grow its armies ever stronger against the harsh tides of battle, and when the opposition fights back with force, it’s giant, shield-like arms dig themselves deep into the battlegrounds to take the full brunt of gunfire with hardly a scratch on its surfaces.
