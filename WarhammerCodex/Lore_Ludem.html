              An unusual, but powerful X’Tal, this being’s splittable, fractal-based form allows it to easily take on multiple enemies at once while expending as little effort as possible, as well as alter its own shape for the situation. Trying to make sense of its appearance will leave anybody with less of an understanding and more of a raging headache.

                <br><br><br>
                If two Ludem were to meet during combat, the enemies would be surprised to see that they would collide with each other violently, and become and amalgamate into an even bigger beast. 

                                <br><br><br>

                The Ludem’s ability to bring together the X’Tal is unprecedented. Using a sort of pseudo-symbiosis, they can fuse with any X’Tal being, becoming one with them and adding their own power to the host.

                                <br><br><br>
For instance, a Ludem that fuses with an Adamantia Neo would be capable of summoning giant crystalline pillars and detonating them to instantly kill a mass of enemies in a single instant. The power that the X’Tal gain from the Ludem is extraordinary and not to be looked down upon.
