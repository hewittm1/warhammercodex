                       The players will alternate deploying their units, one at a time, starting with the player, who did not pick their deployment zone. A player’s model must be set up within their own deployment zone. Continue setting up units until both sides have set up their army.

                         The player who finished setting up their army first can choose to take the first or second turn. If they decide to take the first turn, their opponent can roll a dice; on a roll of 6, they manage to seize the initiative, and they get the first turn instead!

                   At the end of battle round 5, the player who had the first turn must roll a D6. On a roll of 3+, the game continues, otherwise the game is over. At the end of battle round 6, the player who had the second turn must roll a D6. On a roll of 4+, the game continues, otherwise the game is over.

                            At the end of the game, the player who has scored the most victory points is the winner. If both players have the same number of victory points, the game is a draw. Victory points are achieved by the following:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                      No Quarter Given: Each player scores 1 victory point for each enemy unit that is destroyed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        First Blood: The first unit, of any kind, to be destroyed during the battle is worth 1 victory point to the opponent at the end of the game. If two or more units from opposing forces are destroyed simultaneously, then both players get 1 victory point. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Slay the Warlord: If the enemy Warlord has been slayed during the battle, you score 1 victory point.

Use this Stratagem immediately before rolling to see if a unit is hit by your Preliminary Bombardment. The unit being rolled for is hit on a 4+ instead of only a 6.                        </p>
