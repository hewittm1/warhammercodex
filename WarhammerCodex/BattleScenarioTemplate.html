                        <p>
                            Create the Battlefield and set up terrain. Next, the players set up 6 objective markers; the players should roll off and, starting with whoever rolls highest, the players alternate placing these objectives markers until all 6 have been set up. The objective markers can be located anywhere on the battlefield, as long as the centre of each is more than 12” from the centre of any other objective marker and 6” from the edge of the battlefield.
                        </p>

                        The players will alternate deploying their units, one at a time, starting with the player, who did not pick their deployment zone. A player’s model must be set up within their own deployment zone. Continue setting up units until both sides have set up their army.

                            The player who finished setting up their army first can choose to take the first or second turn. If they decide to take the first turn, their opponent can roll a dice; on a roll of 6, they manage to seize the initiative, and they get the first turn instead!

                        At the end of battle round 5, the player who had the first turn must roll a D6. On a roll of 4+, the game continues, otherwise the game is over. The battle automatically ends at the end of battle round 6.

                            At the end of the game, the player who has scored the most victory points is the winner. If both players have the same number of victory points, the game is a draw. Victory points are achieved by the following:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Crystal Domination: At the end of each turn, each objective marker is worth 1 victory point to the player who controls it. A player controls an objective marker if they have more models within 3” of the centre of it than their opponent. Keep a running score from turn to turn. At the end of every battle round roll a d6 and replace the respective objective marker with a Power Crystal (see below). If players roll a die for the same objective marker then no objective markers are replaced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Power Crystal: If a Psyker unit is within 3” of a Power Crystal, that unit may use the rule set from the Psychic Maelstrom, Battlezone  (pg 253, Core Rulebook)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        First Blood: The first unit, of any kind, to be destroyed during the battle is worth 1 victory point to the opponent at the end of the game. If two or more units from opposing forces are destroyed simultaneously, then both players get 1 victory point. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Slay the Warlord: If the enemy Warlord has been slayed during the battle, you score 1 victory point.

                            Use this Stratagem when a Psyker unit is within 3” of an Objective Maker during your Psyker phase you may replace the Objective Marker with a Power Crystal until the end of your Psyker phase.
