           Though not very powerful physically, the Jet Obsilisk is prized amongst the collective for its stamina and remarkable ability to turn projectiles right back at its foes using its highly reflective surface and psychic energies, turning anyone into their own worst enemy. This countering power allows it to bravely storm forth on the battlefield with little consciousness to its own well being, as one would have to think wisely on whether their next attack will be worth the potential injuries.

                <br><br><br>
                It can take a warlord class titan missile and be relatively unscathed. Itâ€™s natural toughness knows no bounds, as a form of attack is to roll towards its opponents knocking them back violently with its latent psychic field.
