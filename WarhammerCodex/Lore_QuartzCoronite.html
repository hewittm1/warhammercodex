              A large, floating geoform that acts simultaneously as both a "ship" of sorts for other X'Tal, as well as an aerial weapon that brings terror from the skies. It levitates over the battlefield like a flying fortress, using its energies to let loose powerful shots from miles away. Like its crystal brethren, it can change configuration to fit the scenario at hand.
