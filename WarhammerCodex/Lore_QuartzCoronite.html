           A large, floating geoform that acts simultaneously as both a "ship" of sorts for other X'Tal, as well as an aerial weapon that brings terror from the skies. It levitates over the battlefield like a flying fortress, using its energies to let loose powerful shots from miles away. Like its crystal brethren, it can change configuration to fit the scenario at hand. 

                <br><br><br>
                When a wave of X’Tal invade a planet, the movement is heralded by the shining jewel crown-fortress that is the Coronite. It’s reminiscent of a cruel king’s army coming to take what’s rightfully his. 
                                <br><br><br>
While flying above, the Coronite can drop a squadron of Phites to help out on the battlefield. As it can provide air support as well as ground units, it shouldn’t be ignored.
