           Small fledgelings of the Collective’s hierarchy, what these crystals lack in sheer power, they make up for in numbers and raw tenacity. Without hesitance nor delay, they diligently follow the will of superior X’Tal and attack in special formations according to the task at hand.
                <br><br><br>
Resonites are primarily created by assimilating organic life forms and instilling the Collective’s influence within them. Before long, their sense of individuality will disappear, becoming one with the endless mind of the X’Tal.

                A small army of Resonites were once lead by the Adamantia Neo. During the battle the Neo rode a wave of Resonites into battle, ignoring the rabble and jumping straight to the biggest target. The Resonites know no individuality and serve as tools of war, both figuratively and literally.
