                      <h2>
                      THE CONDUITS OF THE COLLECTIVE: THE VITREOM
                      </h2>
                    <br><p>  The X'Tal collective in itself is an ever-growing mass of information that yearns to spread, consume, and learn ever more from what the cosmos has to offer to their palate. And for such oceans of information to be processed into a cohesive, usable form, the Collective birthed from the depths of its own chaos a manifestation of order itself. An extremely complex entity that, since the birth of the crystalline race itself, lended its power to further the growth of the Collective a thousandfold and then some, sorting every scrap and detail of what countless drones bring back to the great Motherstones looming amidst the stars.

<br><br>
                       The Vitreom, a great and unknowable kind of entity that flies high above the hierarchy, dictates every geoform's twitch, step, and grating scream across the expanses of space with only but a moment's focus of thought. Arguably one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful geoforms of the X'Tal race, they boasts their brain-like role in the hierarchy with their segmented, spherical shapes and use of psychic power for all of their functions, including their own mobility via hovering. Its deep-layered shell is composed of an endless myriad of different material and substances, some unknown to any modern science, both Imperium or Xenoid. The deeper the layers of its shell, the more impossibly dense the material is, yet very few beings have managed to break even the fifth layer before having their atoms explosively scattered miles apart for their trespasses. 
<br><br>
                      As well, due to what could be presumed as a process to protect the centre of its body, the Vitreom uses its psychic power to add almost any and all material it collects onto its chimeric shell of the different glasses, metals, and minerals that it comes across, adding to its already deep layers to protect the mystery that is its core. Despite its collectionist habits, it makes sure to carefully choose what materials it covers itself with based on what could be interpreted as practicality. Soldiers with particularly interesting or sturdy armour will find their corpses stripped of any decoration that may have been of worth to their fellow brethren, and grafted neatly onto the Vitreom's shell as a sort of trophy.
<br><br>

                      For every major movement of an incoming X'Tal invasion, at least one single Vitreom is at the heart leading the endless mass of X'Tal sprawling across the landscape. It acts as an omniscient conduit for the recorded information taken from geoforms across many different star systems, and then relaying it between all X'Tal so that if one learns something, they all learn. The Vitreom's complex brain can take an amount of information that, with even the smallest fraction, would make any normal psyker's skull explode messily from the overload, as it was created to accumulate an entire galaxy's worth of information and then some. This great amount of information serves as the blueprint that continuously produces bigger and better X'Tal geoforms, specialized breeds fit for all sorts of tasks and purposes to further the Collective's objective.
