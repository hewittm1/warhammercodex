                        <p>
                    Create the Battlefield using the deployment map below then set up terrain. Next, the players set up 6 objective markers; the players should roll off and, starting with whoever rolls highest, the players alternate placing these objectives markers until all 6 have been set up. The objective markers can be located anywhere on the battlefield, as long as the centre of each is more than 12” from the centre of any other objective marker and 6” from the edge of the battlefield.

                        </p>

                          The player who finished setting up their army first can choose to take the first or second turn. If they decide to take the first turn, their opponent can roll a dice; on a roll of 6, they manage to seize the initiative, and they get the first turn instead!

At the end of battle round 5, the player who had the first turn must roll a D6. On a roll of 3+, the game continues, otherwise the game is over.

                            At the end of the game, the player who has scored the most victory points is the winner. If both players have the same number of victory points, the game is a draw. Victory points are achieved by the following:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Take and Secure: At the end of the game, each objective marker is worth 3 victory points to the player who controls it. A player controls an objective marker if they have had more models within 3” of the centre of it than their opponent, and will continue to control that objective, unless their opponent has more models within 3” of the objective marker, then their opponent.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
              Slay the Warlord: If the enemy Warlord has been slain during the battle, you score 1 
victory point.

                        </p>
                        <p>
     Line Breaker: If, at the end of the battle, you have at least one model within the enemy’s deployment zone, you score 1 victory point.
