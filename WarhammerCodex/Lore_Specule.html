     A prismatic entity, it reflects so much light that it appears as if it were more of a divine ghost than a creature formed from crystal and glass. One should never stare too deeply into its light, for that momentary glance is all it takes for it to be their last.

                <br><br><br>
                Like a ghost, the Specule’s own method of defense and transportation is to jump from host to host, primarily those foolish enough to stare for too long. It has a preference for glass or other shining material for its body, but flesh and blood can prove quite conventional for its needs as well. Of course, those whose bodies have been taken are doomed to never move again, their bones unable to keep up with the Specule’s overuse of them.

                                <br><br><br>
Once a particularly strong ray of light hits the specule, it unleashes a veritable inferno of solar powered beams that can melt even steel. Small though they may be, they are still to be feared.
                                                <br><br><br>
As well, if it’s in a fight it can’t handle, the Specule won’t just turn and hide. The X’tal know no fear and have adapted to their surroundings and situations. The Specule can refract in a way that it appears invisible to even the most powerful visual aid. Not even Space Marine-grade Auto-Sense Goggles can detect these creatures.
