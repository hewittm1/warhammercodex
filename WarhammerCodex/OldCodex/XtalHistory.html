                       RISING FROM THE ASHES

                GROUND ZERO
                </h1 >
                <p>
                  After many a hundred turns of Fabius Bile's mistake, the earth of a long-disused forge world was torn asunder by spires of crystal and steel rising up from deep below, partnered by the distorted cries of spirits long forgotten to their native worlds. Blindly and clumsily, man-sized homunculi of pewter, glass, and gemstone hobbled from their nests, consuming all debris and skittering life they came across. They were young and mindless, but these strange beings learned quickly. 

                </p><br>
                <h1>
                TAKEOVER
                </h1>
                    <p>
                  Upon completely devouring its first planet, turning it into the living heart of the collective known as The First Motherstone, the X’Tal reach a milestone in their self-development that gives them the abilities needed to expand on a more cosmic scale, as well as establish a psychic hive connection that grew on the combined psychic energies of the organisms they’ve absorbed. They move onto devouring nearby moons in order to expand their size, number, and resources.


                    </p><br>
                <h1>
                RISE OF THE MOTHERSTONES
                </h1>
                <p>
                     <br>
                    The X’tal continue to expand to the neighboring planet by shooting off a piece of itself into space, beginning a mass restructuring event doomed to infect the entirety of their home star system. The infected planets succumb to the crystal blight and become like sisters to the original Motherstone, proceeding to infect their moons and using tremendous psychic power to manipulate gravity and pull in any other debris nearby. Planets already close to each other became en route for collision courses, absorbing each other to become apart of a greater whole.
                    </p>
                <h1>
                EVOLUTION
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Thanks to their ever growing conquest, the X’Tal are able to advance themselves in mind, body, and capability to a state beyond that of mindless frankensteins of rocks and refuse. From this, larger and stronger X’Tals are produced by the planet-turned-Motherstones, some of which have been dormant on the First Motherstone since the X’Tal were first developing long ago. Because Motherstones are living nests serving only the priorities of the Collective, blueprints for new X’Tal based on what life-forms have been absorbed are communicated and transferred throughout their interlinked network.

                                </p>
                  <h1>
                PLAGUE IN MOTION
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Now that the entirety of the local star system in which the original takeover occured has been infected and restructured to fit the wants and needs of the collective, it has dramatically increasing their power and spreading capabilities. Along with that, they’ve created a method of faster-than-light travel that allows them to shoot “Gemseeds” into the depths of space to infect neighboring star systems at a disturbingly faster rate. This sets forth a new kind of terror to disturb the cosmos.


                                </p>
                <h1>
                DETECTION
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Due to the spread being along the outskirts of Imperium space, the X’Tal's cosmic movements are subtly noticed by various psykers on planets distant the plague due to the disturbance caused by an incomprehensible silence in the Warp. At first, it was mistakenly foreseen as a Tyranid threat due to their similar nature, yet something about this silence was different, yet just as wrong as those of the Hive Fleets. Nonetheless, action must be taken.
                                </p>
                  <h1>
                THE THREAT
                </h1>
                <p>
                   Local scouts of the Imperium set forth to gain intel on the threat as to gauge information on what was to come. What they came face to face with, none of them were fitted to prepare for, nor were the lifeless remains of the scouted planet's populace the threat was encountered on.<br><br>

                    When the scout ships returned with word, there were not pilots that came from out the doors, but claws composed of ruby and stone.
