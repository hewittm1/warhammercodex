                    <br><p> A large, floating geoform that acts simultaneously as both a "ship" of sorts for other X'Tal, as well as an aerial weapon that brings terror from the skies. It levitates over the battlefield like a flying fortress, using its energies to let loose powerful shots from miles away. Like its crystal brethren, it can change configuration to fit the scenario at hand.

                    <br><p> A serpentine X'Tal that's mainly used for creating tunnel networks, brooding caves (Also known as forming caves), and other areas for the Collective as well as for harvesting resources from a planet's landmass. Sections of its body are designed to rotate at high speeds like a drill, and coupled with its razor-sharp mandibles, this allows it to cut through even the most persistent planet crusts.
