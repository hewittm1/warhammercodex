                    <br><p>  Though not very powerful physically, the Jet Obsilisk is prized amongst the collective for its stamina and remarkable ability to turn projectiles right back at its foes using its highly reflective surface and psychic energies, turning anyone into their own worst enemy. This countering power allows it to bravely storm forth on the battlefield with little consciousness to its own well being, as one would have to think wisely on whether their next attack will be worth the potential injuries.

                    <br><p> The Euhedral is one of the many entities in its class that is capable of unleashing the true might of the X’Tal Collective. Forged from a high number of particular gene-seeds absorbed via hot environments in which glass is found to be naturally formed, this entity prides itself in a sleek and sharp-edged design that allows for unnatural speed and maneuverability when it comes to combat. Its higher intelligence allows it to execute tactical strategies unbefitting of what many would call a “glorified rock”.
