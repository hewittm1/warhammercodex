                           Never illuminating its true strategy, a Warlord can contort its prismatic form to guise multiple threats in a the illusion of one.

                            An X'Tal Warlord proceeds uts trek relentlessly, only formidable cries of prior victims' agonies more piercing than its material shredding against the terrain.
