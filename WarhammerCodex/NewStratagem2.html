                              Through centuries of discipline, the Gem masterfully possesses the knowledge to wield duo psychic powers.

                            Use this Stratagem when a <b>Gem</b> unit successfully manifests their last psychic power in a Psychic phase. That psyker can attempt to manifest an additional psychic power this turn.

                            Alone, the odds are improbable, but united, the X’Tal can prevail against even the mightiest of champions.

                              Use this Stratagem at the end of your Movement phase. Choose an Infantry unit from your army that is within 2” of another Infantry unit from the same (Materia). You can merge these squads into a single unit and they are treated as such for the rest of the battle.(“Consolidate Squads” Astra Militarum p.134)
