                            After failing to expeditiously eliminate the opposition, the X’Tal are forced back to the point of entry. Empowered by the  proximity to their Motherstone, the remaining X’Tal prepare for one final conflict, deciding their fate on the conquest of this planet. Having bolstered their army, the (Defenders) seek retribution for the wanton destruction of their planet. Neither side is sure of what awaits them after this battle, but one thing is clear: The final victor shall decide the fate of this world. For if the X’Tal manage to rule the planet, the danger it would present to the rest of the universe would be unprecedented.

The players then alternate deploying their units, one at a time, starting with the player, who did not pick their deployment zone. A player’s model must be set up within their own deployment zone. Continue setting up units until both sides have set up their army.
