                   1<br> Round Brilliant Cut
                </h1>
                <i><p>
                    Warlords relish in having more reflective faces to further exemplify the horror displayed by their adversaries.
                    </p></i>
                <p>
                  Subtract 1 from the Toughness characteristic of enemy units that are within 6” of your Warlord
                </p><br>
                 <h1>
                    2<br> Unearthed but Not Ungrounded
                </h1>
                 <i><p>
                     It is this Warlord's manner to stow any amount of ammunition possible in its kaleidoscpoic entity.                    </p></i>
                    <p>
                        You can re-roll failed wounds when attacking enemy units with your Warlord
                    </p><br>
                  <h1>
                     3<br> Illuminetting
                </h1>
                 <i><p>
                     Opponents of the X'Tal gaze in despondency as bullets vanish in blinding flashes of light upon impact, the crystalline surface exposing itself unscathed.                    </p></i>
                <p>
                    Roll a dice each time this Warlord loses a wound. On a 6, the Warlord shrugs off the damage and does not lose a wound.
                </p>
                  <h1>
                    4<br>  Illusion by Refraction
                </h1>
                 <i><p>
                     Never illuminating its true strategy, a Warlord can contort its prismatic form to guise multiple threats in the illusion of one.                    </p></i>
                  <p>
                          
                      Roll a dice for each enemy that is within 3” of your Warlord at the start of each fight phase. On a 6, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

                                </p>
                  <h1>
                     5<br> Smoke & Mirrors
                </h1>
                 <i><p>
                     An X'Tal Warlord proceeds its trek relentlessly, only formidable cries of prior victims' agonies more piercing than its material shredding against the terrain.                    </p></i>
                <p>
                          Re-roll failed charge rolls for your Warlord. In addition, if your Warlord charges in the Charge phase, add 1 to his Attacks characteristics until the end of the Fight phase.
                                </p>
                <h1>
                   6<br> Hope Diamond              
                </h1>
                 <i><p>
                     Lesser roles in combat know better than to cast their eyes upon an X'Tal Warlord. Such is a sign of disrespect for the dead and dishonor upon themselves.                    </p></i>
                <p>
                          Your opponent must subtract 1 from hit rolls they make for any of their Infantry and Beast units that target your Warlord.
