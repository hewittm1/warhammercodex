                    <br><p>  A spherical X'Tal, both stubborn and high in numbers, that can be produced in a number of ways. Artificially, they're produced by using the minerals drifting within a planet's ocean, and naturally, they're the result of when a persistent piece of material or biomatter stays on a larger X'Tal's body for far too long. They're akin to parasites and bottom-feeders with they way they latch onto any moving surface within their space, but with host X'Tal, they may form a symbiotic relationship and follow their every command.<br><br>

                    <br><p> An unusual, but powerful X’Tal, this being’s splittable, fractal-based form allows it to easily take on multiple enemies at once while expending as little effort as possible, as well as alter its own shape for the situation. Trying to make sense of its appearance will leave anybody with less of an understanding and more of a raging headache.
