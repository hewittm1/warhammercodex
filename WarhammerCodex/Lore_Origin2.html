       RISE OF THE X'TAL

From that point on, the scorched earth from where these strange crystals rose up continued to grow, to encroach upon the ruins and wreckage of the long-destroyed lands and turn what was deemed only as rubbish into something new. Something pure, and crystalline. Something that was soon to become part of them and fuel the movements of a new life that sought to consume what man has long forgotten, and eventually what man no longer deserved to have.

They moved onto the blistering deserts, the quiet rivers, the densest forests, and even the greatest mountains. Nothing was wasted and nothing was spared, especially not the flora and fauna that populated these areas. Everything was to become crystal, and everything was to belong to the Collective.

It took not years, not months, but only a matter of Terran weeks before a significant portion of the first planetâ€™s surface was reduced to a glimmering mass of crystal, glass, and warped minerals where organic matter used to reside. Soon, diamond spires pierced the skies and sprawling roots of jet and quartz dug its claws deep into the planet's mantle and as well as many oceans, so that not even the birds or the fish were safe from the crystal menace's influence, their wings freezing into hard, reflective edges and their fins stiffening with the copper that replaced it.

                <p>
Eventually, the plague increased in its pace and the planet was all but consumed, its entire surface a great, shining shell of its former self.

                  <p>
But the crystal plague didn't stop there. With an entire planet becoming a part of them, there was only more mass needed to consume, more potential to spread on into the far reaches of the system and beyond, starting with the adjacent moons near the planet that wandered a little too close to the rising spires during their cycle. From there, the intelligence of the collective grew and created crystal satellites of a sort to shoot onto the neighboring planets within the star system, causing even newer plagues upon their unsuspecting populace and consuming every semblance of both organic and inorganic matter.
