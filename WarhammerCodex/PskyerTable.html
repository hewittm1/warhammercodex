"Within the many is the power of one, and in one, the power of the many."<br><br>

What sets apart the X'Tal Collective from being just a mass of moving rocks is the boundless depth of their accumulated knowledge and their unnatural capability to learn and adapt for any situation. Not only is this thanks to the Gene-seed organs that lended to their initial makeup, but also the incredible psychic energies built up from the collection of millions upon millions' worth of minds taken in the wake of the Collective’s ever-growing conquest.<br><br>

The so-called "spirit" of the X'Tal lies not in their sharpened edges or titanium-based exoshells, but in the outer forces that drive them to keep learning and to keep consuming until everything is purified in the eyes of the Collective. Granted by the Warp itself, the X’Tal’s range of abilities are cultivated and multiplied for a variety of goals. At the heights of these goals stand the express purpose of subjugating the wills of other worlds and to overtake them, as well as to exert their power into a raw, 
volatile force for decimating those who dare stand in the Collective’s path.<br>
