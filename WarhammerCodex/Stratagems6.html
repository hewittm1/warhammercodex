                There should be some sort of flavor text that goes here. This should be about the X'tal Stratagems and a short description of what these are exactly.

                           Akin to adrenaline and fury within a human being, an X’Tal marksman utilizes ionic excitation to optimize rapidfire.

                            With a great deal of training in patience and combat, the <b>X’Tal infantry</b> can exert focus to optimize their efforts with ballistic weaponry.
                            Use this Stratagem at the end of your Shooting phase. Select a X’Tal Infantry unit from your army - that unit can immediately shoot again.

                           It is told that the X’tal are indiscriminate of who they leech courage from.

                           Use this Stratagem at the beginning of the Morale phase. Select a Friendly <b>X’Tal Infantry</b> unit. Enemy units with 3” of that have their leadership reduced by 2.

                           In their renowned quick wit and wisdom, a Lustrius can recognise when the time arrives to approach and when to disengage.

                              One should not so easily underestimate the speed of the Resonites, for epinephrine still flows through these corroded warriors.
