            Extremely deadly, the Silexia renders its prey to ribbons with its assassin-worthy tactics and skill. It attacks by shattering itself into a self-controllable mass of glass shards, and strikes against its unlucky prey by piercing into their bodies from all sides.

                <br><br><br>
                Its stealthy, yet frail nature prevents it from attacking prey head-on, much preferring to stalk them in the dead of night or ambushing them from hidden spots in the ground. Despite being made almost entirely of broken glass, itâ€™s absolutely silent when moving as if it were a ghost.
