                            Throughout this book, you will come across a keyword that is within angular brackets, specifically Materia. This is shorthand for a keyword of your own choosing, as described below.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="KeyDesc">
                        <h1>
                            Materia                        
                        </h1>    
                        <p>
                            All X’Tal units are drawn from a source of Materia. Some datasheets specify what Materia the unit is drawn from. If an X’Tal datasheet does not specify which Materia it is drawn from, it will have the Materia keyword. When you include such a unit in your army, you must nominate which Materia that unit is from. You then simply replace the Materia keyword in every instance on that unit’s datasheet with the name of your chosen Materia.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, if you were to include a Vitreom in your army, and you decide he was from the Ore Materia, his Materia Faction keyword is changed to Ore.
